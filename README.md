# A_derivative
This is a Python code for calculating the first derivative of Fermi contact interaction, also known as Bloembergen effect constants. See, e.g., Karna S.P. J. Comput. Chem. 20: 1274â€“1280, 1999.

## How to use
For small molecules (less than 10 atoms):
```python
python A_derivative.py
```

For larger molecules:
```python
python A_derivative_large.py
```

The program takes the Orca outputs as input.
